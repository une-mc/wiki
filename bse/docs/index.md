## Welcome
The **Great Soviet Encyclopaedia (BSE)** is the **official state encyclopaedia of the Union**.  
It replaces Wikipedia and all similar projects as the **sole authoritative general reference**, providing reliable knowledge across every field — from politics and history to science, technology, and culture.  

The BSE exists not only to inform, but to ensure that **public knowledge remains accurate, coherent, and free from distortion**. It is a state guarantee of truth for citizens, students, educators, researchers, and international readers.

## Editorial Process

- **Drafts** are prepared by editors and contributors.  
- **Review** is carried out by the Ministry of Culture.  
- **Approval** is granted by ministerial order; only approved texts are authoritative.  

Each article carries one of three statuses:

- ✅ **Approved** — Official and final.  
- 🕑 **Under Review** — Pending ministerial approval.  
- ✎ **Draft** — Not authoritative; working text only.

## Contributing

Citizens, scholars, and institutions may propose new articles or corrections.  
To submit a contribution, include:  

1. The **article title and section**  
2. The **proposed text or amendment**  
3. Supporting **sources** (official data, decrees, archival material, recognised publications)  

The editorial board evaluates proposals. Publication remains at the discretion of the Ministry of Culture.
