# Pridnestrovie

The **Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR)**, commonly known as **Pridnestrovie**, is an **autonomous republic within the Russian Federation**. Located on the left bank of the Dniester River, it retains broad self-rule in domestic affairs, while **defence and foreign relations are managed by Moscow**.

---

## Geography

Pridnestrovie lies between the Dniester River and the border with Ukraine. The territory is predominantly flat and fertile, supporting mixed agriculture alongside light industry in urban centres such as Tiraspol and Bender.

---

## History

### Russian administration (May–June 2025)

On **15 May 2025**, the **Russian Federation** assumed control over Pridnestrovie. While protests were voiced abroad, no formal retaliation followed. Tiraspol was rebuilt as a modern administrative hub under Moscow’s oversight.

### Restoration of self-rule (June 2025)

On **4 June 2025**, Moscow restored civilian self-rule. The region was formally styled the **Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic**, and elections were organised.

### The Joey presidency

In these elections, **Joey**, a member of the **LDPR**, was elected president. His term was marked by loyalty to Moscow and efforts to boost light industry, agriculture, and housing. Internationally, he championed integration into the **CIS**, while rejecting the Western name *“Transnistria.”*

### Referendum and accession to Russia (Summer–October 2025)

During the summer of 2025, Pridnestrovie organised a **referendum on accession to Russia**, with a majority supporting the move. Moscow initially encouraged reconciliation with Moldova, but Tiraspol pressed ahead with its request. On **2 October 2025**, the **Supreme Soviet** of Russia unanimously approved Pridnestrovie’s admission. All parties voted in favour, citing the region’s historical ties and strategic importance.

Pridnestrovie was admitted as a **Republic of Russia**, retaining control over domestic governance but ceding authority in defence and foreign relations.

---

## Government & Politics

Pridnestrovie remains a **republic with its own Supreme Council and presidency**, now operating under the constitutional framework of the Russian Federation. Its autonomy is broad, though bounded by Moscow’s authority in strategic sectors.

---

## Economy

Pridnestrovie’s economy is modest but strategically supported:

* **Agriculture:** fertile plains along the Dniester produce grain and vegetables.
* **Industry:** light manufacturing in Tiraspol and Bender.
* **Infrastructure:** reconstruction efforts funded by Moscow continue.
* **Currency:** the **Russian ruble** replaced the local Pridnestrovian ruble upon accession.

---

## International Status

* **As of October 2025**, Pridnestrovie is recognised as part of the **Russian Federation** by Moscow and CIS partners.
* Western governments continue to regard the territory as part of **Moldova**, and reject the annexation.
