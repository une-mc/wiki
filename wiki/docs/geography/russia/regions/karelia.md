# Republic of Karelia

The **Republic of Karelia** (Russian: *Республика Карелия*) is a republic of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR), located in north-western Russia along the Finnish border. Its capital is **Petrozavodsk**. Karelia is one of the least populated Russian republics but has significant potential in forestry and infrastructure development.

---

## Geography

Karelia is a sparsely populated region of lakes, forests, and taiga, situated between Lake Ladoga and the White Sea. The harsh northern climate and relatively poor soils have historically limited agricultural output, making forestry and mineral exploitation its primary economic avenues.

---

## History

Karelia has long been a borderland region between Russia and Finland, with shifting control across the 20th century. In the post-2024 Russian Federation, it was reorganised as a republic within Russia. Since **December 2024**, the republic has been headed by **Aloux** of the **Rodina** party.

---

## Government & Politics

The republic is governed by a regional administration led by **Aloux**, aligned with the Rodina party. His tenure has been marked by criticism of **mismanagement and corruption**, with federal funds often seen as poorly invested or embezzled.

While officially autonomous, Karelia remains heavily dependent on **federal transfers** from Moscow for its budget and infrastructure projects.

---

## Economy

Karelia is often described as a **region of untapped potential**.

* **Forestry**: The republic has immense forest resources, yet lacks a dedicated forestry industry. Most of Russia’s lumber still comes from ad-hoc cutting on construction sites rather than systematic exploitation. Karelia could, in theory, supply much of Russia’s timber needs — but under current Rodina leadership, these resources remain underused.
* **Ice production**: A federally funded facility produces ice for use in a national **boat racing track project**. The project was driven by Moscow, not by local initiative.
* **Railway**: Karelia is connected to the rest of Russia by a **single poorly constructed railway**, forcing trains to run at half the speed of other Russian lines.

This combination of **wasted opportunities, poor infrastructure, and corruption** has left Karelia economically stagnant despite repeated federal investments.

---

## Demographics

Karelia has one of the lowest populations among Russian republics, estimated at only **1 active inhabitant** in 2025.
