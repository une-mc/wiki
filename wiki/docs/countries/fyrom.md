# North Macedonia

**North Macedonia** (Macedonian: *Северна Македонија*) is a state in the Balkans, centred on the capital **Skopje**. Since 2024 it has undergone profound political upheaval, including the proclamation of a monarchy and subsequent Swiss occupation, which remains unrecognised internationally.

---

## Geography
North Macedonia is a **landlocked Balkan state**, bordered by Kosovo, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. Its landscapes range from the **Vardar River valley** to **Lake Ohrid**, a UNESCO World Heritage site.

## History

### Proclamation of the Kingdom (2024)
On **13 June 2024**, a political figure known as **Griddy** declared himself *King Robert I of Macedonia*, establishing a monarchy in place of the parliamentary republic. The proclamation marked a sharp break with previous constitutional traditions and was viewed abroad with scepticism.

### Swiss ambitions and partial occupation (2025)
On **23 April 2025**, Swiss authorities announced negotiations between **Emperor Niklaus** and **King Robert I of Macedonia** (also Duke of Ticino). The communiqué openly discussed the prospect of **integrating Macedonia into the Swiss Realm**, either as three cantons — *Skopje (Schkopje)*, *Ohrid (Ochridt)* and *Vardar (Wardau)* — or as a single canton under special administration.

In the immediate aftermath, Switzerland moved to occupy **Skopje** and its surroundings. This “special administration” was presented as provisional pending decisions of the **Reichsrat**.

### Expansion of occupation (late 2025)
By the end of 2025, Swiss forces extended their control over the entirety of Macedonian territory. This action was widely condemned abroad, with **Russia and the CIS** refusing to recognise the annexation and affirming support for Macedonia’s sovereignty.

---

## Government and Politics
The Kingdom, under **King Robert I**, functioned only briefly as an independent monarchy before Swiss involvement overshadowed its authority. Swiss administration is contested internationally and has not been normalised within global diplomatic frameworks.  

---

## International Status
North Macedonia is now a **disputed territory**:

- **Recognised by some states** as sovereign under King Griddy’s proclamation.  
- **Claimed by Switzerland**, which seeks to incorporate it as cantonal territory.  
- **Seen as illegaly occupied** by most of the international community, including the **CIS bloc**.
