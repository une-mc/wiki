# Russian Federation

The **Russian Federation** (Russian: Российская Федерация, *Rossiyskaya Federatsiya*) is the largest state in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. Established in its present form in 2024, it is the successor to the pre-existing Russian state, restructured under a programme of political and administrative reform. Russia retains Moscow as its capital and largest city, and continues to function as the principal political and economic power in the region.

## Geography

The Russian Federation extends across Eastern Europe and Northern Asia, sharing land borders with Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, and numerous other states. It commanded coastlines on the Arctic Ocean to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the east.
Its territory included a wide variety of landscapes, from the European plain and the Ural Mountains to the Siberian taiga and Far Eastern maritime regions. Russia’s sheer scale and diverse environments shaped its strategic and economic position throughout the Federation’s brief existence.

## History

### Formation and the Rodina coalition (2024)

The **Russian Federation** formally came into being on **9 May 2024** with the adoption of a new constitution. Conservatives, social democrats, and independents briefly united in the **Rodina (Motherland) coalition**, pledging to rebuild the nation. Moscow was the first focus of reconstruction, its revival symbolising the ambition of a state “rising from the ashes.”

### Fracture and the rise of the Social Democrats

The Rodina coalition soon collapsed under ideological contradictions. By late 2024, the **Social Democratic Party (SDP)** had emerged as the dominant force, stabilising government and pushing a programme of assertive reform.

### The Leviy Povorot and Five-Month Industrialisation Plan

Central to this was the **Leviy Povorot** (*Left Turn*), centred on the **Five-Month Industrialisation Plan**. Smolensk became the spearhead of heavy industry, while Tver underwent deindustrialisation. Moscow saw extensive rebuilding to modernise infrastructure and symbolise resilience.

### Federal restructuring

The Federation rationalised its patchwork of subnational entities: *krais* and autonomous oblasts were abolished, leaving republics with limited autonomy. The **Jewish Autonomous Oblast** was dissolved and annexed to Khabarovsk, with officials framing the reform as one of efficiency and cohesion.

### Foreign policy evolution

Initially cautious in its outreach to Europe, the Federation refused integration with Western institutions such as **Eurorail** and the **NEEU**. By 2025, Russia had shifted decisively toward post-Soviet integration, founding the **Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)** at the Minsk Summit.

### Attempts at constitutional reform (2025)

By mid-2025, political consensus was forming that the 2024 Constitution was a flawed compromise, prone to instability. On **16 September 2025**, the Supreme Soviet adopted the so-called **September Constitution**, which aimed to abolish the presidency, strengthen parliament, and reconstitute the state as the **RSFSR**.  

However, only 45% of deputies supported the draft. On **19 September 2025**, the **Supreme Court of Russia** ruled that such a relative majority was insufficient to replace the constitution, invalidating the reform. The Russian Federation thus continues to exist under the 2024 framework, while debates over future constitutional change remain unresolved.

## Government & Politics

The Russian Federation functions as a **federal parliamentary republic**. Although the 2024 Constitution initially envisaged a **dual executive** with a strong Presidency, subsequent amendments shifted authority decisively toward the legislature and Prime Minister.

* **Prime Minister:** The head of government, elected by and accountable to the **Supreme Soviet**. Holds responsibility for day-to-day governance, cabinet formation, and proposing legislation.
* **President:** Originally endowed with powers to dissolve parliament and appoint the PM, the office was reduced by constitutional amendments to a **largely ceremonial role**. Today, the President serves mainly symbolic and representational functions.
* **Supreme Soviet:** A **unicameral legislature** seated in the Moscow White House. It holds primary law-making authority, including the right to amend the constitution, approve governments, and call elections. Coalition dynamics dominate its sessions, reflecting the fractured party system.
* **Federalism:** The Federation preserves a union of republics and oblasts, though reforms abolished autonomous oblasts. Republics retain extensive autonomy; oblasts are administered under a standardised model.
* **Party system:** Politics is characterised by constant **coalition manoeuvring**. The Social Democrats and Communists often partner to secure reforms, while liberal and conservative blocs play pivotal roles as kingmakers or opposition.

The Russian Federation is effectively governed by a **parliamentary majority**, with the Prime Minister as the centre of executive authority and the Supreme Soviet as the decisive institution.

## Economy

The economy is dominated by **heavy industry**, with Smolensk as its industrial hub and Tver redirected toward light industry.
Food security is achieved through a mixed system, including Nether-sourced supplies and domestic agriculture. Infrastructure expansion, especially rail, underpinned industrialisation.


On **21 September 2025**, Russia was among the first countries to adopt the **euro (€)** as its reserve and trade currency, replacing the **diamond**. This move was coordinated with **Britain** and **Ukraine**, marking a major shift in international economic alignment and signalling Russia’s intent to integrate more closely with its key partners.

## Symbols

* **Flag:** Red–white–light blue tricolour, used prior to the 1993 Yeltsin coup attempt.
* **Coat of arms:** Soviet-style emblem with wheat, hammer and sickle, and a red star.
* **Anthem:** *Широка страна моя родная* (*Wide is My Motherland*).
* **Motto:** None officially adopted.
