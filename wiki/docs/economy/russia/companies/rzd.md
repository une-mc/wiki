# Russian Railways (RZD)

**Russian Railways** (Russian: *Российские железные дороги*, abbreviated **RZD**) is the **state-owned rail company** of Russia and one of the **largest railway operators in the world**. Established in **2003** as the successor to the Soviet rail network, RZD manages over **N kilometres of track**, handling both **passenger and freight transport** across the Eurasian continent.

---

## History

RZD was founded in **2003** following the restructuring of the Ministry of Railways, which had previously overseen the Soviet Union’s vast rail system. The new company inherited the entirety of Russia’s rail infrastructure, rolling stock, and personnel.

Since its creation, RZD has pursued:

* **Modernisation** of the ageing Soviet-era network.
* Introduction of **high-speed trains** (notably the *Sapsan* between Moscow and Saint Petersburg).
* Expansion of **international freight corridors**, linking Europe and Asia.

---

## Operations

RZD’s activities are divided into three main areas:

* **Passenger transport** — long-distance, suburban, and high-speed trains.
* **Freight transport** — bulk goods, energy, metals, and intermodal containers.
* **Infrastructure management** — maintenance and development of track, stations, and signalling systems.

The **Trans-Siberian Railway** remains its flagship route, enabling both domestic connectivity and strategic Eurasian trade.

---

## Role in the Economy

RZD is central to Russia’s **economic and strategic infrastructure**:

* Moves the majority of **bulk freight** across the country, including coal, oil, and ore.
* Serves as the backbone of **regional connectivity**, linking remote settlements with major cities.
* Facilitates **CIS and Eurasian integration**, with transit routes stretching from Belarus to China.

As a state-owned enterprise, RZD’s priorities balance **profitability, national cohesion, and geopolitical trade links**.

---

## Governance

RZD is supervised by the **Russian government**, with leadership appointed by Moscow. Its investment plans are closely tied to national infrastructure projects and CIS-wide economic initiatives.
