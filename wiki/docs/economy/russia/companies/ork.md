# United Resource Corporation (ORK)

The **United Resource Corporation (ORK)** (Russian: *Объединённая ресурсная корпорация*, ОРК) is a **state-owned mining and resource conglomerate** of Russia. Created in **2025**, the ORK unites the country’s largest extraction and raw-material companies under one umbrella, giving the state direct control over most of its **strategic resources**.

---

## History

The ORK was founded as a **national holding company** to centralise Russia’s diverse but fragmented mining, energy, and metallurgical industries. Rather than leaving key sectors to operate independently, the government decided to pool them under one coordinated structure — ensuring steady domestic supply and strengthening Russia’s position in global markets.

Its creation was inspired by earlier state corporations like **Rostec** in defence and aviation, but focused specifically on **raw materials**.

---

## Subsidiaries and Operations

ORK oversees nearly all of Russia’s resource base:

* **Gazprom** — natural gas.
* **Rosneft** — oil.
* **Alrosa** — diamond mining.
* **Norilsk Nickel** — nickel, palladium, platinum, rare metals.
* **Rusal** — aluminium.
* **Severstal** — steel.
* **Evraz** — coal and metallurgy.
* **RosGeo** — geological exploration.

This structure makes the ORK a **one-stop national resource corporation**, spanning energy, metals, and mining.

## Role in the Economy

ORK is one of the largest **state revenue sources** in Russia:

* Guarantees domestic supply of oil, gas, coal, metals, and diamonds.
* Coordinates exports to the CIS and selected global markets.
* Provides raw inputs for heavy industry, military production, and infrastructure.
* Manages geological surveying and reserves.

It plays a role comparable to Rostec, but for natural resources rather than defence.

---

## Governance

The ORK is directly supervised by the **Council of Ministers** and the **Ministry of the Economy**. Its leadership is appointed by the state, and it reports on production, export, and revenue directly to Moscow.
