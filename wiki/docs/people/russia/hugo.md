# Hugo von Namsgrad

**Hugo von Namsgrad** (Russian: *Хьюго фон Намсград*; born in Nantes, France, early 2000s) is a Russian statesman who has twice held the office of **Prime Minister of the Russian Federation**: first from **May to July 2024** during the short-lived Rodina coalition government, and again since from **August 2024 to February 2026**, leading successive left-wing coalitions. Since **January 2026**, he has served as **Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)**. He is also the leader of the **Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDRP)**.

## Early life

Born into a working-class family in **Nantes**, von Namsgrad spent part of his youth in a gentrified town in the northwest of the metropolitan area. The sharp contrasts between affluence and exclusion in that environment shaped his early class consciousness.

Returning to Nantes proper, he grew up surrounded by the city’s strong student and industrial activism, which brought early exposure to radical-left politics. While initially sympathetic, he gradually shifted toward a more moderate, parliamentary social-democratic outlook.

Von Namsgrad also became involved in the **Breton regionalist movement**, advocating for the reunification of Loire-Atlantique with Brittany. He participated in cultural initiatives to promote the Breton language and regional autonomy.

He studied at the **University of Nantes**, completing a Master’s degree in Education and qualifying as a secondary-school teacher. He later worked in high schools across Brittany, combining his professional career with cultural and political involvement.

In 2024, he moved to Russia, drawn by the country’s newly reformed constitutional order and the opportunities it opened for social-democratic politics. At this point, he adopted the name **“Hugo von Namsgrad”**—a Russified homage to his native city of Nantes (historically *Naoned*, known as *Namsberg* under Viking settlement).

## Political career

### Entry into Russian politics (2024)

Von Namsgrad entered politics as part of the **Rodina Coalition**, quickly establishing himself as a prominent social-democratic figure. He was elected to the Supreme Soviet in May 2024 and took on ministerial portfolios linked to industry and development during the coalition’s first government.

### First premiership (May–July 2024)

Appointed Prime Minister on **29 May 2024**, von Namsgrad led a fragile multiparty coalition. His government introduced early reforms in industrial modernisation and welfare, but internal disputes between conservative and communist factions caused the coalition to collapse. He was succeeded by **Xee** on 11 July 2024.

### Return and SDP–KPRF coalition (August 2024 – June 2025)

After a no-confidence vote toppled Xee, von Namsgrad returned as Prime Minister on **5 August 2024** at the head of a left-wing coalition between the **Social Democratic Party** (SDP) and the **Communist Party of the Russian Federation** (KPRF). His cabinet launched the **Five-Month Industrialisation Plan**, introduced the **diamond-backed ruble**, and implemented state-led welfare and price controls.

### RSDRP–Yabloko coalition and centrist phase (June 2025 – January 2026)

Following the June 2025 parliamentary elections, the RSDRP entered a centrist governing coalition with **Yabloko**. The new government pursued partial economic liberalisation, removing strict price controls and ending the diamond currency peg while maintaining core welfare programmes and expanding infrastructure through mixed public–private investment.

During this period, von Namsgrad initially supported cautious economic opening as Russia and several allied states adopted the euro as a reserve and trade currency. However, the rapid expansion of speculative financial activity across the Commonwealth increasingly strained coalition unity and contributed to the RSDRP’s gradual return toward anti-capitalist economic policy.

### Confederation and dissolution of parliament (January – February 2026)

In **January 2026**, following the creation of the Commonwealth confederal executive institutions, von Namsgrad assumed the post of **Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)** while continuing to serve as Prime Minister domestically.

Shortly thereafter, he played a central diplomatic role in resolving the Geneva sovereignty crisis, negotiating the restoration of the city’s neutral international status. The episode intensified internal government conflict after disagreements with Yabloko leadership regarding private financial interests connected to the dispute.

Citing irreconcilable ideological and governance differences, von Namsgrad dissolved the Supreme Soviet in early 2026, triggering snap elections. The election resulted in a decisive victory for the socialist left and the formation of a renewed RSDRP–KPRF alliance government.

Von Namsgrad declined to seek another term as Prime Minister, instead choosing to focus on his role directing foreign policy for the CIS. He was succeeded by KPRF leader The0nlyBob following the formation of the new parliamentary majority.

## Political ideas

* **Economy:** State-guided industrial modernisation, with “strategic enterprises” in energy, transport, and heavy industry, balanced by regulated private enterprise.
* **Foreign policy:** Integration within the **CIS**, scepticism toward Western-led projects such as Eurorail, preference for pragmatic bilateral relations.
* **Social welfare:** Universal healthcare, tuition-free higher education, indexed pensions, and income protection via social transfers.
* **Governance:** Strengthening the Premier’s parliamentary accountability and supporting the presidium model of collective head of state, preserving federal autonomy for oblasts and republics, and ensuring cultural rights for minority languages.
* **Equality:** Advocates a universalist approach—rejecting quotas and identity-based policies—in favour of broad social and economic rights for all citizens.
* **Environmental policy:** Supports conservation targets, polluter-pays levies, renewable energy expansion, and large-scale reforestation alongside industrial growth.
