# 2nd Legislature of the Russian Federation (June–July 2024)

The **2nd Legislature** of the Russian Federation sat from **30 June to 11 July 2024**, making it the **shortest in the nation’s modern parliamentary history**.  
Formed in the wake of the first Rodina-dominated assembly, it was immediately beset by ideological divisions and shifting alliances that brought it to collapse within eleven days.

---

## Composition of the Executive

The government was initially a continuation of the previous **Rodina-led administration**, with **Hugo von Namsgrad** reappointed as **Prime Minister**.  
To maintain a governing majority, Rodina entered into coalition with the **Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)**, which was granted several key ministries, including **Defence** and **Internal Affairs**.

| Office | Name | Party / Faction | Notes |
|--------|------|------------------|-------|
| **Prime Minister** | **Hugo von Namsgrad** | Rodina (Social Democratic Wing) | Reappointed; withdrew from coalition near the end of the term |
| **Minister of Defence** | **Xee** | LDPR | Appointed as part of coalition deal |
| **Minister of Internal Affairs** | (LDPR nominee) | LDPR | Controlled security apparatus |
| **Other portfolios** | Various | Rodina (Conservative faction) | Technocratic holdovers from 1st Legislature |

The coalition, bridging **social democrats** and **far-right nationalists**, was ideologically unstable from the outset. Many Rodina deputies viewed the inclusion of the LDPR in the cabinet as a betrayal of the coalition’s centrist mandate.

## History of the Legislature

### Election and Formation

The election of the 2nd Legislature was held under the standing convention of monthly parliamentary renewal.  
The results produced an **evenly divided chamber**:  
- **Rodina** retained 40 seats,  
- the **Narodnyy bloc** (*People’s Coalition*) — formed by communists, socialists, and disillusioned Rodina members — won 40 seats,  
- and the **LDPR** secured 20 seats, becoming the balance of power.

In an attempt to preserve control, Rodina entered into a coalition with the LDPR, creating a fragile majority of 60 seats.

---

### Collapse of the Coalition

The Rodina–LDPR partnership quickly fractured.  
Moderate and liberal members of Rodina denounced the alliance as **opportunistic and incoherent**, while the leftist and socialist factions refused to cooperate with what they saw as a reactionary government.  
This prompted a wave of defections and political realignment:
- The **liberal wing** of Rodina split off to form **Yabloko**.  
- The **social democratic bloc** around Hugo von Namsgrad separated into the **Social Democratic Party (SDP)**, precursor to the **RSDRP**, joined by many from Narodnyy.  
- The **radical left** of the Narodnyy bloc reorganised under the **KPRF**.

By early July, the legislature had effectively ceased to function.  
With Rodina reduced to its conservative core and the LDPR isolated, the government lost its parliamentary majority.  

---

### Dissolution and Legacy

Recognising the paralysis, **Prime Minister Hugo von Namsgrad** dissolved the legislature on **11 July 2024**, calling for **snap elections** in an attempt to regain a workable majority under a coherent social-democratic platform.  

The 2nd Legislature’s collapse marked the **end of the Rodina era** and the **birth of Russia’s modern party system**, as its implosion directly produced the parties that would dominate later politics: **RSDRP**, **KPRF**, **Yabloko**, and a strengthened **LDPR**.
