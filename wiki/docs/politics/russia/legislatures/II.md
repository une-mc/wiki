# 2nd Supreme Soviet (June – July 2024)

The **2nd Supreme Soviet** sat from **30 June to 11 July 2024**, lasting barely two weeks — the shortest legislature in the modern history of the Russian Federation.  
It emerged from the **Rodina coalition era**, but its composition and contradictions ensured its rapid disintegration.

The election produced a **deadlocked chamber**:  
- The **Rodina coalition**, representing the centre-right and social democrats, secured **40 %** of the seats.  
- The **Narodnyy group** (*“People’s Coalition”*) — a loose alliance of communists, socialists, and radical leftists who had split from Rodina — also gained **40 %**.  
- The **Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)** obtained **20 %**, positioning itself as kingmaker.

In order to retain a majority, **Rodina entered a coalition with the LDPR**, an uneasy partnership between moderate social democrats and hardline nationalists. The arrangement immediately alienated Rodina’s left wing and centrist liberals, who denounced the pact as opportunistic and ideologically incoherent.

The legislature became **paralysed**, marked by walkouts, abstentions, and leadership crises. The **Narodnyy bloc** refused cooperation, while Rodina’s own members split into rival factions. Within days, **new parties began to crystallise** out of the chaos:  
- the **KPRF** and **RSDRP** emerged from the dissolved Narodnyy bloc,  
- **Yabloko** asserted its independence from Rodina,  
- and even the **Prime Minister**, nominally aligned with Rodina, distanced himself from the collapsing coalition.

With no functioning majority and no capacity to legislate, the Supreme Soviet was **dissolved on 11 July 2024**, triggering new elections and the formation of the **3rd Legislature**.  
Despite its brevity, the 2nd Supreme Soviet marked the **definitive end of the Rodina era** and the beginning of Russia’s modern multi-party system.
