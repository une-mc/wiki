# 5th legislature of the Russian Federation (January – June 2025)

The **5th legislature of the Russian Federation** sat between **8 January and 4 June 2025**, representing a period of consolidation after the success of the Five-Month Industrialisation Plan and the first major test of Russia’s new political pluralism.  
It was characterised by **heightened ideological polarisation**, **foreign interference scandals**, and the **return of the nationalist right** to the legislature.

---

## Composition of the Executive

| Office | Name | Party / Faction | Notes |
|--------|------|------------------|-------|
| **Prime Minister** | **Hugo von Namsgrad** | RSDRP | Continued from 4th Legislature; led coalition with KPRF |
| **Deputy Prime Minister (Industry & Trade)** | (KPRF appointee) | KPRF | Oversaw continuation of industrialisation plan |
| **Minister of Economy** | (RSDRP appointee) | RSDRP | Introduced diamond peg and price controls |
| **Minister of Foreign Affairs** | (RSDRP appointee) | RSDRP | Advocated diplomacy with Germany and CIS unity |
| **Minister of Defence** | (KPRF appointee) | KPRF | Directed military build-up and strategic posture toward Europe |

The executive reflected a genuine **power-sharing arrangement** between the **social democrats** and **communists**, with KPRF ministers gaining influence in defence, industry, and internal planning.  
This balance moved Russia further left than at any time since 2024, edging toward a **command economy** with tight state control over all sectors.

---

## Election and Background

The **January 2025 election** unfolded amid **crisis and scandal**.  
The **Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)**, finally re-registered after its earlier exclusion, ran a fiery populist campaign portraying itself as the *voice of the silenced opposition* and *enemy of corrupt elites*.  

Meanwhile, the **Rodina Party** — long thought politically dead — attempted a comeback, claiming administrative competence through its control of **Karelia**. Its campaign quickly imploded when leaked documents revealed that **German authorities had directly funded** Rodina’s programme and paid its leader, **Alex**, roughly **32,768 rubles** for political cooperation.  
The revelation — later confirmed in court — sparked **national outrage**, effectively destroying Rodina’s remaining support and tainting pro-Western politics in general.

To distance itself from the scandal, the **RSDRP** partnered with the **KPRF**, allowing the communists to lead the campaign under a patriotic, anti-interference platform. The two parties ran a **joint electoral list**, alternating candidates by party order.  
This “People’s Bloc” won **60 seats**, while the **LDPR** capitalised on public anger to claim **40**, doubling its previous strength. **Yabloko** and **Rodina** both failed to cross the electoral threshold.

## Governance and Policy

With a secure though narrower majority, the RSDRP–KPRF coalition continued the economic transformation begun under the 4th Legislature.  
However, the new balance of power — with the communists holding half the government’s parliamentary support — shifted policy further left:

- **Institutionalisation of the diamond peg** of the ruble, formalising its link to mineral reserves.  
- **Strict price controls** on food, housing, and manufactured goods to prevent speculative inflation.  
- Expansion of **state ownership** in energy and metallurgy.  
- Renewed **industrialisation programmes**, though less centralised than the Five-Month Plan.  
- Consolidation of a **planned economy** modelled on self-sufficiency and internal markets.

The legislature also pursued a markedly **assertive foreign policy**, reflecting growing KPRF influence.  
Russia imposed **embargoes on Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg**, citing economic interference and subversion.  
Tensions with **Poland** erupted after the discovery of **mob grinders constructed above Russian territorial waters**.  
In response, Russian forces conducted **precision missile strikes** on the installations, framing the operation as a legitimate act of sovereignty:  
> “We destroyed illegal structures inside *our own* borders. There is nothing further to discuss.”  
The incident drew international criticism but bolstered domestic confidence in Moscow’s resolve.

In **May 2025**, Russian troops assumed control of **Pridnestrovie (Transnistria)**, citing the region’s unstable governance and strategic importance.  
Within **three days**, Tiraspol was rebuilt and reorganised in classic *Soviet-style rapid construction*, complete with administrative, industrial, and housing infrastructure.  
The operation was presented as a stabilisation mission but effectively reasserted Russia’s dominance over the Dniester corridor.

Meanwhile, plans were announced for the construction of a **deep-water port in Sevastopol**, symbolising a revival of Russia’s Black Sea ambitions.  
Though no work began, the project was intended as both a logistical goal and a statement of sovereignty.  
When **Ukraine regained player representation**, all Russian installations on the Crimean Peninsula were **peacefully handed over** to Kyiv upon request — an act widely praised as a gesture of goodwill and respect for borders.

By mid-2025, the Russian Federation had entered a new phase of **self-reliant assertiveness**: economically insulated from the West, militarily confident, and ideologically united under the banner of socialist reconstruction and national sovereignty.


---

## Dissolution and Legacy

By late May 2025, internal tensions began to erode the leftist alliance.  
The **KPRF** advocated an increasingly militant stance toward Germany and Poland, while the **RSDRP** pressed for diplomacy and trade normalisation.  
During a heated session of the **Supreme Soviet**, the **LDPR** introduced a **motion of no confidence** in the government — unexpectedly supported by the KPRF.  

The motion passed on **4 June 2025**, dissolving the legislature and triggering new elections.  
Though short-lived, the 5th Supreme Soviet left an enduring mark as the **pivot point of modern Russian socialism**: the moment when autarky, economic control, and strategic independence became permanent fixtures of state policy.

It also marked the **resurgence of the nationalist right**, setting the stage for the **RSDRP–Yabloko coalition** that would follow in the 6th Legislature and steer Russia toward a new phase of pragmatic governance.
