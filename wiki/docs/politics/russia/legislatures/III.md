# 3rd Legislature of the Russian Federation (July–August 2024)

The **3rd Legislature** of the Russian Federation sat from **11 July to 4 August 2024**, lasting less than a month.  
It was characterised by an unprecedented coalition between the **liberal Yabloko party** and the **far-right Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)** — a partnership that quickly collapsed amid ideological conflict and political mistrust.

---

## Composition of the Executive

Following the legislative election, the **Yabloko–LDPR coalition** formed a majority of 60 seats out of 100.  
Under the coalition agreement, **Xee (LDPR)** was appointed **Prime Minister**, marking the first time a nationalist leader held executive power in post-Rodina Russia.  
Yabloko retained key portfolios in the economic and justice sectors, while the LDPR held the ministries of **Defence** and **Internal Affairs**, consolidating control over the state’s security apparatus.

| Office | Name | Party / Faction | Notes |
|--------|------|------------------|-------|
| **Prime Minister** | **Xee** | LDPR | Appointed under coalition agreement |
| **Deputy Prime Minister / Minister of Economy** | (Yabloko appointee) | Yabloko | Oversaw liberal reforms |
| **Minister of Defence** | (LDPR appointee) | LDPR | Continued from previous LDPR-controlled cabinet |
| **Minister of Internal Affairs** | (LDPR appointee) | LDPR | Retained LDPR control of domestic security |
| **Minister of Justice** | (Yabloko appointee) | Yabloko | Pushed party registration and transparency laws |

The coalition presented itself as a “government of balance,” aiming to stabilise the country while reconciling liberal reformism with nationalist assertiveness.  
In practice, the ideological gulf between the partners proved unbridgeable.

## History of the Legislature

### Election

The **July 2024 parliamentary election** was held amid widespread fatigue with the Rodina era and the collapse of the previous coalition.  
Opinion polls had consistently predicted a victory for the **left bloc**, led by the newly formed **RSDRP**, with support from the **KPRF** and other socialist movements.  
In practice, however, the vote produced a far more fragmented result:

- **Yabloko** surged to prominence, capitalising on the collapse of Rodina and emerging as the preferred choice for moderate and right-leaning voters.  
- The **LDPR** retained roughly its previous strength, consolidating its nationalist base.  
- The **RSDRP** performed strongly but fell short of an outright majority.  
- The **KPRF** entered parliament for the first time, with **five deputies** elected on the RSDRP’s joint list.  
- **Rodina**, having splintered after its coalition’s collapse, failed to meet the electoral threshold and lost all representation.

The outcome left no clear majority, setting the stage for an improbable alliance between ideological opposites.

---

### Formation

Following the election, **Yabloko**, now the main liberal force in parliament, rejected cooperation with the **RSDRP** and opted instead to partner with the **LDPR**, framing the move as a bid for “national unity and pragmatic governance.”  
The coalition controlled **60 of 100 seats**, combining Yabloko’s 40 and LDPR’s 20.  
The decision astonished both domestic and foreign observers, who viewed it as an unnatural alliance between two political poles — a pro-European liberal party and a hardline nationalist movement.

---

### Tensions and Breakdown

From the outset, the coalition was mired in disagreement:
- **Yabloko** promoted market liberalisation, openness to foreign investment, and civil liberties.  
- **LDPR** prioritised protectionism, expanded military spending, and limits on dissent.

Tensions peaked when Yabloko introduced a **party registration and oversight bill**, designed to prevent groups deemed hostile to the republic from operating legally.  
The **LDPR** condemned the proposal as a veiled attack on itself and accused Yabloko of hypocrisy and subversion.  
The legislature soon became paralysed by mutual distrust, procedural gridlock, and personal animosity between coalition leaders.

---

### No-Confidence Vote and Dissolution

On **4 August 2024**, Yabloko withdrew from the coalition and joined the **RSDRP** and **KPRF** in a **vote of no confidence** against **Prime Minister Xee (LDPR)**.  
The motion passed easily, dissolving the government and ending the legislature after only three weeks in session.  

Its collapse triggered **snap elections**, producing the **4th Legislature**, in which the **RSDRP–KPRF left bloc** secured a decisive victory and brought an end to the cycle of unstable coalitions that had characterised early post-Rodina politics.

---

## Legacy

Though lasting less than a month, the 3rd Legislature is remembered as a **turning point in Russian coalition politics**.  
It demonstrated the volatility of post-Rodina realignments and confirmed the impossibility of durable cooperation between liberal reformers and nationalist populists.  
The ensuing backlash against Yabloko’s experiment with the LDPR would shape the party’s more cautious and centrist stance in subsequent years.
