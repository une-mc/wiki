# 6th Legislature of the Russian Federation (since June 2025)

The **6th Legislature of the Russian Federation**, elected on **4 June 2025**, marks a new phase in the evolution of the Russian Federation — one defined by **pragmatic centrism**, **economic reopening**, and a cautious **normalisation of foreign relations**.  
It comprises **100 seats** and is governed by a coalition between the **Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDRP)** and **Yabloko**, together holding **65 seats**.  
The **KPRF**, **Rodina**, and **LDPR** form the opposition, providing a balance between socialist hardliners and nationalist conservatives.

## Composition of the Executive

| Office | Name | Party / Faction | Notes |
|--------|------|------------------|-------|
| **Prime Minister** | **Hugo von Namsgrad** | RSDRP | Continued from previous legislature; leads moderate reformist coalition |
| **Deputy Prime Minister (Economy)** | (Yabloko appointee) | Yabloko | Oversaw liberalisation and end of price controls |
| **Minister of Industry** | (RSDRP appointee) | RSDRP | Prepared groundwork for renewed five-month industrial plan |
| **Minister of Foreign Affairs** | (Yabloko appointee) | Yabloko | Promoted détente and European trade normalisation |
| **Minister of Defence** | (RSDRP appointee) | RSDRP | Oversaw partial troop withdrawals and CIS defence integration |

## Election and Formation

The **June 2025 election** followed the collapse of the previous RSDRP–KPRF coalition.  
Voters sought stability after months of economic tension and ideological fatigue.  
The RSDRP campaigned on a platform of **moderate socialism**, **diplomacy**, and **domestic stability**, while Yabloko promised **economic modernisation** and **international reintegration**.  

The two parties entered into a **centrist coalition**, pledging to maintain social programmes while dismantling the more radical mechanisms of the command economy.  
Their alliance, though pragmatic, left deep ideological contrasts between socialist and liberal visions of Russia’s future.

---

## Governance and Policy

The 6th Legislature began by **reversing the excesses** of the previous government while preserving its core social achievements.  
Among its first measures were:

- Establishing a **civilian administration in Pridnestrovie**, and withdrawing Russian troops save for a symbolic security force.  
- **Abolition of price controls** and the **diamond peg of the ruble**, restoring market flexibility.   
- Maintaining **social guarantees**, housing programmes, and public welfare from earlier socialist reforms.  
- Launching new **industrial investment incentives** to attract domestic and foreign capital.

The government also took a markedly more **diplomatic approach** abroad.  
Relations with the West cautiously improved: tensions with Poland persisted, but the administration initiated **the Minsk Conference**, resulting in the creation of the **Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)** with Belarus and Ukraine.  
Russia’s adoption of the **euro as a trade and reserve currency**, shared across much of Europe, facilitated a rise in exports and renewed industrial investment.  
Germany, once under embargo, emerged as a major economic partner.

Domestically, the leftist paries in the legislature sought to draft a **“Socialist September Constitution”**, backed by the RSDRP and KPRF to enshrine social ownership and parliamentary supremacy.  
However, the **Constitutional Court** ruled that such a reform required a supermajority — effectively halting the process and fuelling debate over the parliament's legitimacy to reshape the state’s foundations.

## Pridnestrovie Integration

Initially reluctant to incorporate Pridnestrovie, the federal government encouraged **dialogue with Moldova**.  
However, after repeated requests from Tiraspol, and following the republic’s four-month period of self-administration, the **Supreme Soviet voted overwhelmingly** to accept its admission into the Federation on **2 October 2025**.  
Pridnestrovie became an **autonomous republic**, retaining control over all domestic affairs aside from **defence and foreign policy**.

---

## Challenges and Prospects

The rise of the **Euro economy** presents both opportunities and dilemmas for Russia.  
While exports and investments are growing, divergent opinions within the coalition — between **social-democratic planners** and **Yabloko liberals** — occasionally create friction.  
The failure of the September Constitution and ongoing disputes over the balance between state control and market freedom have reignited speculation that **new elections** may be called, allowing the left to seek a renewed mandate reminiscent of the dominance of the 4th Legislature.  

Despite these challenges, the 6th Supreme Soviet stands as the most **stable and internationally engaged** legislature since 2024, guiding Russia through a period of cautious prosperity and political maturity.
