# 1st Supreme Soviet (May – June 2024)

The **1st Supreme Soviet** of the Russian Federation was elected on **29 May 2024**, serving until its dissolution on **30 June 2024**.  
It was the **first legislature** established under the **post-Rodina constitutional framework**, marking the beginning of the new Russian parliamentary order.

The chamber was dominated by the **Rodina coalition**, which secured **60 %** of the seats and governed alone, while the **Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)** held **40 %** and acted as the principal opposition.  
The **Communist Party (KPRF)** and several minor leftist movements failed to cross the electoral threshold, leaving the legislature divided between a technocratic centre and a nationalist right.

The **Rodina government** pursued a deliberately **technocratic and stabilising agenda**, aimed at rebuilding institutions, reviving the economy, and restoring internal order after years of political instability.  
Its leadership, composed of social democrats, centrists, and moderate conservatives, sought to govern pragmatically and avoid ideological confrontation.

The **LDPR**, by contrast, refused cooperation from the outset. Viewing Rodina’s programme as elitist and unpatriotic, it denounced the coalition as “unrepresentative” and called for stronger executive authority and nationalist policy.  

Although the **1st Supreme Soviet** completed several administrative reforms, its fragile structure and growing ideological polarisation made its collapse inevitable.  
The far-right’s intransigence, coupled with internal divisions within Rodina, led to a **snap dissolution on 30 June 2024**, paving the way for the **2nd Legislature** and the fragmentation of the Rodina bloc into modern parties such as **RSDRP**, **KPRF**, and **Yabloko**.
