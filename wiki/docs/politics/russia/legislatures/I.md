# 1st Legislature of the Russian Federation (May–June 2024)

The **1st Legislature of the Russian Federation** was elected on **29 May 2024**, serving until **30 June 2024**.  
It was the **first parliamentary body established under the 9 May 2024 Constitution**, marking the start of Russia’s modern constitutional order following the dissolution of earlier transitional authorities.

The election resulted in a decisive victory for the **Rodina Coalition**, which obtained **60 % of seats**, while the **Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR)** held **40 %** and formed the opposition. The **Communist Party (KPRF)** and several smaller left-wing groups failed to reach the electoral threshold.

---

## Composition of the Executive

The executive authority during the 1st Legislature was held by a **Rodina-led technocratic government** appointed by the President and approved by the legislature.

| Office | Name | Party / Faction | Notes |
|--------|------|------------------|-------|
| **Prime Minister** | **Hugo von Namsgrad** | Rodina (Social Democratic Wing) | Appointed with Rodina backing on 29 May 2024 |
| **Deputy Prime Ministers** | Various | Rodina (Conservative Faction) | Oversaw finance, defence, and infrastructure portfolios |
| **Cabinet** | Mixed technocratic and conservative figures | Rodina coalition | Designed to prioritise reconstruction over ideology |

Although Rodina’s dominant faction was **social democratic**, several key ministries were entrusted to **conservative members**, in line with the coalition’s principle of non-partisan, pragmatic governance.  

The LDPR, holding 40 seats, refused all participation in the cabinet and served as a **vocal opposition**, accusing the government of elitism and weak national policy.

## History of the Legislature

### Background and Election

The 1st Legislature was convened two weeks after the adoption of the **9 May 2024 Constitution**, the first such election under the new political order.  
The Rodina coalition, a broad alliance of social democrats, liberals, conservatives, and independents, campaigned on a platform of **national recovery and stability**, seeking to restore central governance and rebuild administrative capacity.  

The LDPR ran on a nationalist and populist programme, calling for a stronger presidency and more assertive domestic policy, but ultimately failed to dislodge Rodina’s dominance.

---

### Governance and Activity

The legislature’s month-long session was devoted primarily to **institutional reconstruction** and **administrative normalisation** rather than ideological reform.  
Key initiatives included:
- Reestablishment of **ministerial oversight** across the economy and internal affairs.  
- Initial planning for **industrial and infrastructural restoration** in Moscow and Smolensk.  
- Efforts to **stabilise the currency and budget**, laying the groundwork for later fiscal reform.  

The Rodina government’s emphasis on technical rebuilding reflected a deliberate decision to avoid divisive political debates during the fragile early recovery.

---

### Dissolution and Aftermath

Unlike later constitutions, the **9 May 2024 Constitution** did not define a legislative term length.  
By convention, it was agreed that elections would be held **monthly**, leading to the 1st Legislature’s dissolution after a single month.  

This informal arrangement was never repeated, as the rapid succession of unstable legislatures that followed demonstrated the impracticality of constant monthly elections.
After mid-2024, the convention evolved toward a flexible parliamentary cycle, allowing governments to call new elections at their discretion or when the legislature withdrew confidence.

---

### Legacy

The 1st Legislature laid the administrative foundation for Russia’s parliamentary system but exposed early ideological fractures between the technocratic centre and nationalist right.  
Its brief existence demonstrated both the potential and fragility of the Rodina experiment, setting the stage for the political realignments that defined 2024–2025.
