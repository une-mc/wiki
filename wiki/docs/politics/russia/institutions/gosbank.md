# Gosbank

**Gosbank** (Russian: *Госбанк*, short for *Gosudarstvenny Bank*) is the **state-owned central and commercial bank of Russia**, re-established in **2025** as a continuation of the historic **State Bank of the USSR**. It serves simultaneously as the **issuer of the national currency**, the **manager of foreign reserves**, and a **principal lender** to state enterprises and strategic sectors of the economy.

## History

The original **Gosbank of the USSR** (1921–1991) functioned as the world’s largest centralised bank, holding a monopoly over credit and currency within the planned economy. Following the Soviet Union’s collapse, it was dismantled and fragmented into smaller institutions.

In **2025**, amid Russia’s economic restructuring, the state revived Gosbank as both a symbolic and practical institution. Its creation was presented as a return to **economic sovereignty**, consolidating control over finance under a single roof.

## Functions

Gosbank operates in a **dual capacity**:

* **Central Bank:**

  * Issues the **Russian ruble (₽)**.
  * Manages monetary policy, foreign exchange reserves, and the transition to the **euro (€)** for reserve/trade purposes from September 2025.
  * Oversees regulation of other banks within Russia.

* **Commercial Bank:**

  * Provides credit to **state-owned enterprises** such as Rostec, RZD, and ORK.
  * Funds major infrastructure projects (rail, energy, housing).
  * Offers limited commercial services to citizens, such as savings accounts and state-guaranteed mortgages.

## Role in the Economy

Gosbank is described by officials as the **“financial spine of the Russian economy.”** By combining central banking with direct commercial lending, it ensures that credit flows to priority sectors regardless of market fluctuations.

Its revival also reflects Moscow’s desire to **shield national finance from external shocks** and strengthen integration with post-Soviet partners. Discussions are already underway for Gosbank to become the **financial backbone of the CIS**, though these remain preliminary.

---

## Symbolism

The re-establishment of Gosbank is widely seen as an **ideological gesture**, linking the modern Russian state with its Soviet predecessor. Its name and emblem were deliberately chosen to evoke continuity with the USSR, projecting stability and sovereignty in a period of constitutional uncertainty.

Officials describe it as *“a bank not only of capital, but of the nation itself.”*
